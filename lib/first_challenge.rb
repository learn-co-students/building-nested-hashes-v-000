# In `lib/first_challenge.rb`, you're going to fill out the content of the `epic_tragedy` hash. The first level of our
# nested hash are the keys for the family names, "Montague" and "Capulet". We've made them symbols above, because symbols
 # make better hash keys than strings.
# * Set the `epic_tragedy` variable equal to a hash with two key/value pairs. The keys should be symbols of the family
# names (`:montague` and `:capulet`) and the values should be empty hashes.
# At this point, we have a hash that looks like this:
# ```ruby
# epic_tragedy = {
#   :montague => {},
#   :capulet => {}
# }
# ```
# Now it's time to fill out the second level of our hashâ€”the collection of data that constitutes the value hashes of
# each family name key.
